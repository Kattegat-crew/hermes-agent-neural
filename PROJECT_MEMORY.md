# Hermes Project Memory & Session Continuity

> **Session Lifecycle Contract**:
> - **On Session Start**: Read this file and [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](file:///opt/hermes-agent/ARCHITECTURE.md) to recover active context and understand current flows before taking any action.
> - **On Session Close**: Update this file with what was accomplished, verification results, and immediate next steps.

## 1. Active Focus & Current Goal
* **Current Initiative**: Pilot implementation of the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) governance framework, project memory, and code reusability guardrails across Hermes and DEV agents.
* **Lead Agent**: Antigravity (`agy`) / Ragnar.
* **Target Path**: [`/opt/hermes-agent/`](file:///opt/hermes-agent/).

---

## 2. Handover from Last Session
* **Completed**:
  - Established `.agents/rules/` with `01-sdd-workflow.md`, `02-vps-guardrails.md`, and `03-code-standards.md`.
  - Created `.specs/` repository index and base templates (`01-spec.md`, `02-design.md`, `03-tasks.md`).
  - Created [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](file:///opt/hermes-agent/ARCHITECTURE.md) documenting active daemons, WhatsApp persistence invariants, and reusable code catalog.
  - Configured `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` as the official session continuity ledger.
* **Verified by**:
  - File presence and permissions (`chown -R hermes:hermes`).
  - Process audit confirmed active running daemons (Ragnar, Roshi, Vigia, WhatsApp bridge on `:3000`, Dashboard on `:9112`).
* **Pending / Incomplete**:
  - Establish rule `04-memory-and-reuse.md` in `.agents/rules/`.
  - Update `AGENTS.md` and `SOUL.md` to bind all external CLI agents and internal Hermes fleet profiles to this memory and reuse contract.

---

## 3. Operational Decisions & Gotchas
* **Separation of Concerns**: Kept `ARCHITECTURE.md` (static operational truth and reusable code inventory) decoupled from `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` (ephemeral session state) to protect system maps from accidental agent truncation and prevent prompt cache degradation.
* **WhatsApp Session**: Never touch `/opt/hermes-agent-data/whatsapp/session/` (symlink `/opt/data/whatsapp/session/`).
* **Ownership**: All project files must remain owned by `hermes:hermes`.

---

## 4. Next Immediate Actions
- [ ] Implement `.agents/rules/04-memory-and-reuse.md`.
- [ ] Synchronize `AGENTS.md` to reference `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PROJECT_MEMORY.md`, and `04-memory-and-reuse.md`.
- [ ] Synchronize `SOUL.md` so internal Hermes fleet agents abide by the same memory and code reuse rules.
